[![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/EliotVU/UT2004-MutLoadedLevel/total)](https://github.com/EliotVU/UT2004-MutLoadedLevel/releases)

Removes all the initial weapons you spawn with, except for the ShieldGun:

- Once a kill is made you will lose the ShieldGun and earn the AssaultRifle and so on.
- Once you suicide(or accident) you de-level meaning you'd lose the AssaultRifle and start again with the ShieldGun.
